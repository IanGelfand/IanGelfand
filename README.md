##Projects

Chug Mugs - https://chugmugs.herokuapp.com/
An e-commerce web app based on selling mugs
Users were able to make an account, shop through all mugs, and see individual
mugs, as well as add them to a cart and purchase them.
Used technologies such as express, sql, react-redux, as well as css, html, and
javascript
Cat Adoption App - https://expo.io/@iangelfand/cat-adoption-app
An app based around using a pet adoption API that would allow users to scroll
through animals and adopt ones they adored.
A 4-day hackathon where I learned new technologies including react-native and
petfinder API.
eBudget - http://ebudget-fsa.herokuapp.com/
A financial helper that helps users with their finance.
It was build in 20 days and uses Plaid API to allow users to securely log into their
bank and access their information such as balance and transactions.
EBuget allows users to see transaction from all their bank account, displays charts
of user spending by month and year, as well as set a budget and create a saving
calculator.
